Project Idea 1: Travel Planner with Weather Integration (o)

Description:
The project idea is to create a Travel Planner application, integrating user profiles with OpenWeatherMap and Sygic Travel APIs.
The project envisages a development of a Travel Planner application that leverages third-party authentication mechanisms such as Google or Facebook OAuth for secure user logins. 
The app would assist users in planning trips by correlating weather forecasts and travel destinations,
informing users about the expected weather conditions at their chosen location, and suggesting points of interest, hotels, tours, and activities based on their preferences.
The back-end would fetch and cache relevant data from both APIs, preventing excessive calls and improving performance.
By storing user preferences and travel plans in the database, the application can provide personalized travel suggestions and weather forecasts,
creating a robust and user-tailored travel planning experience.


Project Idea 2: A Health and Environment Monitoring App (x)

Description: 
The app would make use of the user's location and health data to provide recommendations for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.The app leverages third-party authentication mechanisms such as Twitter or Facebook OAuth for secure user logins.By utilizing two APIs, one from a weather data provider such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and another from a health and fitness data provider,
such as Fitbit or Strava, we could correlate environmental conditions with user's health data.
This could result in real-time personalized advice such as optimal times for outdoor exercise based on weather conditions, pollen count for those with allergies,
and pollution levels. User authentication would be provided through a third-party service such as Google or Facebook,
and the back-end would be responsible for data correlation, storage, and retrieval, communicating with the front-end via a RESTful API.
