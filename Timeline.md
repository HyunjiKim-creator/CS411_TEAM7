# Project Timeline


## Meetings
* We formed group chats to coordinate and determine the meeting time. We conducted our weekly meetings either during the lab section, after class, or through Zoom and phone calls.
* During our initial meeting, we had a discussion about the project topics and created a detailed whole project timeline. We worked together diligently, regularly exchanging project updates, brainstorming ideas, and actively troubleshooting issues. 

## Assignment 1
* Each team member contributed two ideas, resulting in a total of ten proposals. After deliberation, we narrowed down our focus to health and the environment, leading to the final selection of four ideas:
  1. Weather and Crime Tracker
  2. Travel Planner with Weather Integration
  3. Healthier You, Healthier Food Choice
  4. Real-time Environmental Condition & Personalized Health Advice.
