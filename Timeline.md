# Project Timeline


## Meetings
* We formed group chats to coordinate and determine the meeting time. We conducted our weekly meetings either during the lab section, after class, or through Zoom and phone calls.
* During our initial meeting, we had a discussion about the project topics and created a detailed whole project timeline. We worked together diligently, regularly exchanging project updates, brainstorming ideas, and actively troubleshooting issues. 

## Assignment 1 _ Proposal
* Each team member contributed two ideas, resulting in a total of ten proposals. After deliberation, we narrowed down our focus to health and the environment, leading to the final selection of four ideas:
  1. Weather and Crime Tracker
  2. Travel Planner with Weather Integration
  3. Healthier You, Healthier Food Choice
  4. Real-time Environmental Condition & Personalized Health Advice.
     
* We ultimately selected two ideas for our project: 1) Travel Planner with Weather Integration and 2) A Health and Environment Monitoring App.Our final project choices were determined through a voting process, and we selected the first idea (Travel Planner with Weather Integration.
* More information about these ideas can be found on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/HyunjiKim-creator/CS411_TEAM7/blob/main/README.md).
