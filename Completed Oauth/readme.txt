I finished the Oauth thing, but it is a little complicated to run. First you will need to run the server.js by typing in command window "node server.js" you will need to have node json installed before you run it. Then you will open your browser and type in the address "http://localhost:3000/" then you will see the application. Then you can click the login button and choose your google account.
